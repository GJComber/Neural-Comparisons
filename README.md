# Neural-Comparisons
This is a program using neural networks with a binary classifier model to predict if a startup applicant will be successful. Three different model variations are shown to allow a comparison between different model builds.

## Modelling and Selection
Several extensions of the models demonstrated here were explored while looking for improvements. Predominantly using larger amounts of neurons in the same structures but these proved to be counter productive. I have chosen to demonstrate the models in sequence of depth and complexity. The models here initially demonstrated minor improvements over their predecessor in terms of both loss and accuracy. Subsequent runnings of the code have however, not replicated this. The three models now appear to produce approximately the same performance metrics.
